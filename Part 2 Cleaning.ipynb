One of the people working phones got a call from a student about their Nintendo Switch not connecting to the Residence Hall internet. This is a somewhat common call as Switches are incompatible with the  802.1X authentication our network used. \\n\\nThe person working the phone did their best to explain this in English to an astonished customer, and long story short the customer flipped. He threatened the phone agent, found our address, then said he'd be over in 10 minutes to kill us all unless we let his Switch on the network. Essentially being a glorified receptionist this was relayed to me and fulltime staff were made aware and decided to invite the University Police over, who happened to be our office neighbors. \\n\\n10 minutes go by and there's me, 3 staff members, and 2 cops standing in our dingy little walk-up area, when a student who must've been 5'6\" 120 lbs walked in with one hand in a fist and the other cradling his Switch. Beyond that, it wasn't particularly eventful but it was the first arrest of several I saw in my two years working there.</td>\n",

I'm going to change the phone priority and have $breaker take it. Would you warn him?\\n\\n&amp;gt; $gingBeard: $Breaker? If you say so.\\n\\nThe MSP we worked for would gave discounts to customers (all businesses) if they agreed to be bumped down the call priority. I guess this was a fine enough deal for companies that only had us for calls outside business hours. Then, there's was $KioskCo, who sent us tickets twice in the year I was there. Both handled by $breaker and both involved a several hour wait because they decided they wanted max discount and were always at the bottom of the call priority. Always. \\n\\nAs $Breaker told it, the call went like this:\\n\\n*Introductions*\\n\\n&amp;gt; $KioskCo: Because of [ERROR: REASON NOT FOUND] the last girl started a print job that's going to print, uh, maybe six or seven thousand pages? Well the printer started smoking so I called you. \\n\\n&amp;gt; $Breaker: The printer is running a six or seven thousand page job and started smoking when you called six hours ago?\\n\\n&amp;gt; $KioskCo: Yes.\\n\\n&amp;gt; $Breaker: Is, is the printer still running? \\n\\n&amp;gt; $KioskCo: Yes. The print job isn't finished. And the smoke coming out of it is getting pretty dark\\n\\nAtleast 30 seconds of uninterrupted silence pass as his prefrontal cortex BSoD's and reboots. \\n\\n&amp;gt; $Breaker: Can you stop the print job? And then unplug the printer.\\n\\n&amp;gt; $KioskCo: But the print job isn't finished. \\n\\n&amp;gt; $Breaker: I'll, I'll fix that after. \\n\\nAfter convincing the woman to unplug the printer he got her to take the printed pages out of the room and call (I think) an electrician and their local non-emergency emergency services phone number.\\n\\nI don't know if he ever fixed the interrupted print job.</td>\n",

I had just gotten my first promotion and was finally allowed to go on-site and work in our walk-in area. One of the people working phones got a call from a student about their Nintendo Switch not connecting to the Residence Hall internet. This is a somewhat common call as Switches are incompatible with the  802.1X authentication our network used. \\n\\nThe person working the phone did their best to explain this in English to an astonished customer, and long story short the customer flipped. He threatened the phone agent, found our address, then said he'd be over in 10 minutes to kill us all unless we let his Switch on the network. Essentially being a glorified receptionist this was relayed to me and fulltime staff were made aware and decided to invite the University Police over, who happened to be our office neighbors. \\n\\n10 minutes go by and there's me, 3 staff members, and 2 cops standing in our dingy little walk-up area, when a student who must've been 5'6\" 120 lbs walked in with one hand in a fist and the other cradling his Switch. Beyond that, it wasn't particularly eventful but it was the first arrest of several I saw in my two years working there.   \n",
       "2  &gt; $worksTooMuch: Hey, Ging, can you look at this item in the call queue for me?\\n\\n&gt; $gingBeard: Yeah. Uh, does that say they've been on hold for six hours?\\n\\n&gt; $worksTooMuch: OK. I wanted to make sure I wasn't misreading that. I'm going to change the phone priority and have $breaker take it. Would you warn him?\\n\\n&gt; $gingBeard: $Breaker? If you say so.\\n\\nThe MSP we worked for would gave discounts to customers (all businesses) if they agreed to be bumped down the call priority. I guess this was a fine enough deal for companies that only had us for calls outside business hours. Then, there's was $KioskCo, who sent us tickets twice in the year I was there. Both handled by $breaker and both involved a several hour wait because they decided they wanted max discount and were always at the bottom of the call priority. Always. \\n\\nAs $Breaker told it, the call went like this:\\n\\n*Introductions*\\n\\n&gt; $KioskCo: Because of [ERROR: REASON NOT FOUND] the last girl started a print job that's going to print, uh, maybe six or seven thousand pages? Well the printer started smoking so I called you. \\n\\n&gt; $Breaker: The printer is running a six or seven thousand page job and started smoking when you called six hours ago?\\n\\n&gt; $KioskCo: Yes.\\n\\n&gt; $Breaker: Is, is the printer still running? \\n\\n&gt; $KioskCo: Yes. The print job isn't finished. And the smoke coming out of it is getting pretty dark\\n\\nAtleast 30 seconds of uninterrupted silence pass as his prefrontal cortex BSoD's and reboots. \\n\\n&gt; $Breaker: Can you stop the print job? And then unplug the printer.\\n\\n&gt; $KioskCo: But the print job isn't finished. \\n\\n&gt; $Breaker: I'll, I'll fix that after. \\n\\nAfter convincing the woman to unplug the printer he got her to take the printed pages out of the room and call (I think) an electrician and their local non-emergency emergency services phone number.\\n\\nI don't know if he ever fixed the interrupted print job.   \n",
